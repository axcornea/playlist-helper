# Playlist helper

Tool to manage, convert, export, import playlists from different media service providers.

## Overview

### Current version

There is nothing you can do with this tool right now. Check it out later.

### MVC

The following set of features is in the scope of MVC:
1. Converting Spotify's "Liked Songs" into a playlist.
2. Exporting Spotify's playlists into some common playlist file format.
3. Converting playlists to/from Apple Music
4. Converting playlists to/from VK
5. Converting playlists to/from YouTube

Some media sources listed above can not be implicitly trusted. By this I mean that you can upload any video on YouTube
and give it any arbitrary name. This is a potential problem that will require additional checks using 3rd party tools
like Shazam or anything more developer-friendly.

### MVP

Scope of MVP:
1. Provide user-friendly Android app for this API.
2. Provide user-friendly iOS app for this API.

## How to run
